    <h1>Terceira island (Azores): a guide to visit the island [with map] on your own (things to do, where to eat and sleep…)</h1>
<b>by Ines and Chris27 March, 2022</b>
<p style="color: green;">A capital that is a Unesco heritage site (Angra do Heroísmo), a blanket of green-grass patchwork woven inside the largest crater of the Azores (Serra do Cume) and a unique volcano in the world that we can enter and look at the sky from inside (Algar do Carvão). Just because of these three attractions it is worth visiting the third largest island of the archipelago, but Terceira offers much more to those who visit it. There are dips in clear waters between lava flows in Biscoitos, biodiverse trails between mistérios negros, steaming cauldrons and the largest areas of endemic vegetation of the whole archipelago, and all these plans are combined with delicious gastronomy, good wine and festivities, lots of festivities.
In this guide we try to reflect all that Terceira has to offer with practical tips, itineraries from 2 to 7 days, where to sleep and even where to eat to make your trip as incredible as ours was.</p>

<h1>Things to do in Fuerteventura: best beaches, towns and secret places</h1>
<b>by Ines and Chris5 May, 2020</b>
<p style="color: green;">Fuerteventura hides, in our opinion, the best beaches in the Canary Islands. In addition to beaches, you will find towns full of history, windmills between arid winding roads, kilometer-long dunes and a delicious gastronomy. In this post you will find everything you need to explore Fuerteventura on your own: what to see, how to get there, how to move, where to stay and where to eat.
